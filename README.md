This is an Android application that will go through two tasks:

Task 1:
Create an Android application which includes a fragment and an activity. The fragment
should display a list with 100.000 colored list-items.
Please colorize the items following this logic:
- If the index of an element is divisible by 3 without remainder: colorize the
element RED.
- If the index of an element is divisible by 5 without remainder: colorize the
element BLUE.
- If the index of an element is divisible 3 and 5 without remainder: colorize the
element YELLOW.
After a device-rotation the app should show the same list-element as before the
rotation.


Task 2:
Make the list items clickable and open a new fragment that displays the color of the
clicked item.


Bonus:
Extract the number/color logic from Task 1 into a separate class and write a Unit Test
for this logic.
